    <h2>Hawaiian Sausage Stiry Fry Dish</h2>
    <p>
      I made this up one day when I couldn't find a recipe anywhere with these
      ingredients. So I kind of <strong>threw it together on a whim</strong>.
      Sugar can be adjusted for sweetness, and if the sauce gets a bit thicker
      than desired I suggest adding a little chicken broth as it's
      thickening.<em>Serve immediately over rice</em>.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or more to taste</li>
      <li>
        1 (16 ounce) package Polish sausage, or to taste, cut into 1-inch
        squares
      </li>
      <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 large green bell pepper, cut into 1-inch squares</li>
      <li>¾ fresh pineapple - peeled, cored, and cut into chunks</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
      <li>½ cup pineapple juice, or more to taste</li>
      <li>⅓ cup packed brown sugar, or to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons cider vinegar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir sausage,
        onion, and green bell pepper until vegetables start to become tender,
        about 8 minutes; add pineapple and cook, stirring occasionally, until
        the pineapple is hot, about 5 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat pineapple juice and cornstarch together in a bowl using a whisk.
        Stir brown sugar, cider vinegar, soy sauce, and minced garlic with the
        pineapple juice until the sugar dissolves into the liquid; pour over the
        sausage mixture and cook until the sauce thickens, 5 to 8 minutes.
